-------XSS--------


Reflected XSS

Reflected attacks are delivered to victims via another route, such as in an e-mail message, or on some other website. When a user is tricked into clicking on a malicious link, submitting a specially crafted form, or even just browsing to a malicious site, the injected code travels to the vulnerable web site, which reflects the attack back to the user’s browser.

Stored XSS

Stored attacks are those where the injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum.


General payload for testing XSS in every input

"><script>alert(1);</script>

Other payloads:

Make a test using Intruder and dictonaries with multiple payloads.

!Important! XSS attacks may be conducted without using <script></script>.
Other tags will do the same thing like:

onload, onmouseover, onerror, SRC, etc.

example:
<body onload=alert('test1')>
<b onmouseover=alert('Wufff!')>click me!</b>
