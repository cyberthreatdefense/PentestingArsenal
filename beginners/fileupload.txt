------------File Upload-------------------

1.Find what extensions are accepted ---> look especially for .php, .pl, .exe etc.
2.If there are only some file extensions that are accepted---> try change the content type using Burp
3.Try for example shell.php.png and in burp change with shell.phpD.jpg---> D=44(hex)...change 44 with 00 in Hex tab(null byte)
4.If gif are accepted--> try the gif that contain php code inside
5.Same with the jpeg, png---> use exiftool for changing the content of any picture
